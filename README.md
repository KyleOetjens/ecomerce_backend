## Installation

Open in integrated terminal, you will need to first navigate to the db folder and open the terminal on the sql file.  Open mysql using the "mysql -u root -p" command (you will need to enter your root PW) and then run source schema.sql;.  After you have set up the db, exit mysql and in the integrated terminal on server.js run npm run seeds, then node server.js (make sure you are using your credentails for mysql)

## Usage
